abstract="The train routing and timetabling problem consists of setting routes and schedules of a set of vehicles given their initial timetables and a railway network. The number of vehicles, the complexity and limited capacity of the railway network, and the time constraints make this problem difficult to solve. In this paper, we model this problem as a Multi-Agent Pathfinding problem, and propose a Conflict-Based Search approach to solve it. In our approach, we consider the complex properties found in this scenario such as continuous time, agents that function as convoys of arbitrary length, arbitrary action duration, and railway networks to find a solution. We analyze and discuss our approach explaining the main difficulties and evaluate it on several scenarios.",

abstract = {Abstract Urban Traffic Control is a key problem for most big cities. Current approaches to handle the city traffic rely on controlling traffic lights. The systems in operation range from static control of traffic light phases to adaptive systems based on numeric models and traffic sensors. Recently, some planning-based approaches have also been proposed. These approaches work at a higher level of abstraction, but have been found to work well if complemented by low-level systems. We have identified two main difficulties for the wide use of planning techniques in this domain: generating the control models is a difficult task; and some algorithms scale poorly. In this paper we present Automated Planning for Traffic Control (APTC), a control system based on Automated Planning, that successfully overcomes these two problems. It combines techniques that continuously: learn an accurate planning model; and also divide the city for distributed reasoning in order to scale to large city networks. Experimental results show that APTC outperforms static approaches as well as other planning-based systems. We also show that the combination of both approaches improves compared with using only one of them.}
