  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>I am originally from <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/technology/artificial-intelligence">Candeleda</a>, a small village close to the mountains in the center of Spain. I moved to Madrid to start the Bachelor on Computer Science at <a href="https://www.uc3m.es/Home">Universidad Carlos III</a>, where I also completed my Master in Artificial Intelligence.</p>
  <p> In 2021 I obtained my PhD under the supervision of Professors Susana Fernandez and Daniel Borrajo with the <a href="http://www.plg.inf.uc3m.es/">Planning and Learning Group</a>, also at Universidad Carlos III. The title of my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}thesis_apozanco.pdf">thesis</a> is "Goal Reasoning for Autonomous Agents using Automated Planning", where we study how planning can enhance the autonomy of agents.</p>
  <p>During the PhD I was involved in several research projects, as well as in teaching tasks. I also visited other research institutions such as <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/">RMIT University</a> in Melbourne (Australia), where I collaborated with Prof. Sebastian Sardina.</p>
  <p>Currently, I am working at the <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/technology/artificial-intelligence">J.P. Morgan AI Research Lab</a> in London.</p>
